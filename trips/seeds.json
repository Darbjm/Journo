    "description": "If you need a reason to come to Kilifi, this is it. Both an ecolodge and a backpackers, this place gets it so right. The fantastic owners, staff and guests have created a living, breathing space that\u2019s a haven for everyone. Expect good cheer, good people and good conscience. We love the pizza oven and the amazing bamboo showers. Pretty pathways lead down to the creek, where you can climb aboard a dinghy bound for remote, starfish-studded beaches. Or you can hire a bike, laze in a hammock, or muck in at the vegetable garden.",
